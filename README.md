# Learning Backwards
## Learning Computer Science Through the Lens of React

As someone without a degree in computer science and had to learn some of its concepts through an education of hard knocks and failed interviews, I thought it would be interesting to talk about the intersection of React concepts and computer science concepts.

I have focused on a few topics for this talk, though you could easily go further with each one or find other intersections altogether. They are:

* Big O Notation
* Data Normalization
* Memoization
* Trees

Hope you enjoy the talk and the rest of [Byteconf](https://byteconf.com/)
